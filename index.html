    <h2>plot:</h2>
    <p> ---Like the Dark Souls series, Elden Ring is set in a Western-style fantasy setting[4]. The game takes place in the Betweenlands, a land "behind the veil of fog" that has long been ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal. In the Betweenlands, the will of its ruler determines <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring#:~:text=%D0%93%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9%20%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%8B%20%E2%80%94%20%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B9%2C%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD,%D1%87%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D1%8D%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%20%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%8C%20%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%83.">reality itself. For example, Marika once abolished the natural "predetermined death" - most of the inhabitants of the Betweenlands cannot die a natural death.   </a>      As in the Dark Souls series, most of the inhabitants of the world are more like the living dead, having long since lost the remnants of their minds. The source of Marika's power is the Ring of Elden, a magical object consisting of several Great Runes and dictating the laws of the universe. It was sent to earth by the Great Will - one of the cosmic Outer Gods existing somewhere beyond the Betweenlands[16].</p>

    <p class="fdfdfd"> ---Marika destroyed the old kingdoms of men, dragons, and giants that had once been in the Between-earth. She established her "Golden Order" - a church, a state regime, and a system of laws all at once. The center of the Golden Order was the Tree of Erd - <a class="rrrr"   href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring#:~:text=%D0%93%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9%20%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%8B%20%E2%80%94%20%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B9%2C%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD,%D1%87%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D1%8D%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%20%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%8C%20%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%83.">  a colossal tree in the center of the Between-earth. Marika later waged wars to subjugate other countries to the Golden Order; </a>  to do this, she needed a consort husband - this consort bore the title of Lord of Elden and led Marika's army. With her first husband, Godfrey, Marika bore demigod children Godwin, Morgott, and Mog; she later banished Godfrey and took another lord, Radagon, as her husband, who left his wife Rennala for Marika, but Radagon and Rennala's children - Rikard, Radan, and Ranni - also acquired demigod status. Radagon and Marika had two more children, Mikella and Malenia, also demigods[16].</p>

    <P class="ddd"> ---In time, the Death Rune, part of the Ring of Elden, was separated by Marika and given to her half-man, half-beast half-brother, Maliketh, for safekeeping. Ranni stole the rune, which granted power over death, and on the Night of the Black Knives, her followers killed Marika's firstborn, Godwin the Golden. Marika then shattered the Ring into its individual runes; Radagon tried to reunite it, but was unable to do so. After Marika and Radagon disappeared, a time of turmoil began in the Between-earth known as the Sundering; various demigods tried to claim the fragments of the Ring, the Great Runes, trying to rewrite reality as Marika had done before, pledging allegiance to the Outer Gods, or going to war with each other. The Golden Order fell apart, and no one could take the throne of the Lord of Elden. There are other Outer Gods active in the Betweenlands, such as the Fiery Flame, a deity hostile to the Great Will[16] and its Golden Order.

        The protagonist of the game is an Extinguished, a warrior from somewhere outside the Betweenlands. The Extinguished are able to see "grace" - a special golden light associated with the Great Will and the Ring of Elden; the ultimate goal of each Extinguished is to become the new Lord of Elden, restore the Ring and take the throne of the Betweenlands, but so far none have succeeded. The Extinguished have their own fortress, the Round Table; by the time of the game, it, like the Betweenlands, has fallen into disrepair. The Extinguished are usually guided by Two Fingers - the messenger of the Great Will - and the "finger maidens" who serve him, but the protagonist has not received such a maiden. Early in the game, a stranger, Melina, offers the hero an agreement - she will take the place of the "finger maiden", and the hero will help Melina on her own journey to the Tree of Erd[16].</P>
